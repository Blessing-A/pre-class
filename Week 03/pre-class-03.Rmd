## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



# pre-class


This folder contains your first pre-class assignment. Remember to complete the flipped material first:


## Flipped Material 

- Sign into [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
- Complete [Joining Data in R with dplyr](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-r-with-dplyr) course. 
- Complete these steps for the assignment:
    - Create a new folder in your pre-class Repository called: `Week 03`
    - Copy the `readme.md` and `pre-class-03.Rmd` document into this.
    - Follow the instructions and commit often. 



Then proceed to the Pre Week 03 RMarkdown file, complete this and commit your work often to begin to learn how to make small changes and committing.

### Getting Started


We will work with the dataset called [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder), this is a cleaned up version from [Gapminder Data](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). Gapminder contains a lot of great data on all of the nations of the world. We first need to install the gapminder package in R. 

```
install.packages("gapminder")
```

```{r}
install.packages("gapminder")
```
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

```{r}
library (dplyr)
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```


### Pre-Class Problems

Use **dplyr** functions to address the following questions:

1. How many unique countries are represented per continent?
```{r}
gapminder %>%
group_by (country)
#A total of 142 unique countries are represented per continent
```

2. Which European nation had the lowest GDP per capita in 1997?
```{r}
gapminder %>%
filter(continent == "Europe", year == "1997") %>%
arrange (gdpPercap)
#The European nation with the lowest GDP per capita in 1997 was Albania
```
3. According to the data available, what was the average life expectancy across each continent in the 1980s?
```{r}
year_1980s <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarize(lifeExp = mean(lifeExp))
  View(year_1980s)
  #The average life expectancy across each continent in the 1980s was:
  #1982	Africa	51.59287; 1982	Americas	66.22884; 1982	Asia	62.61794; 1982	Europe	 72.80640; 1982	Oceania	74.29000; 1987	Africa	53.34479; 1987	Americas	68.09072; 1987	Asia	64.85118;	1987	Europe	73.64217; and 1987	Oceania	75.32000
```

4. What 5 countries have the highest total GDP over all years combined?

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(gdpPercap = sum(gdpPercap)) %>%
  arrange (desc(gdpPercap))
  #The 5 countries with the highest total GDP over all years combined are: Kuwait, Switzerland, Norway, United States and Canada
```
5. What countries and years had life expectancies of _at least_ 80 years? _N.b. only output the columns of interest: country, life expectancy and year (in that order)._
```{r}
lifeExp_atleast_80 <- gapminder %>%
  select(-continent, -pop, -gdpPercap)%>%
  group_by(country, lifeExp, year) %>%
  filter (lifeExp >=80)
  #The following countries had years had life expectancies of at least 80years: Australia (2002, 2007); Canada (2007); France (2007); Hong Kong, China (1997, 2002, 2007); Iceland (2002, 2007); Israel (2007); Italy (2002, 2007); Japan (1997, 2002, 2007); New Zealand (2007); Norway (2007); Spain (2007); Sweden (2002, 2007) and Switzerland (2002, 2007) 
  ```
6. What 10 countries have the strongest correlation (in either direction) between life expectancy and per capita GDP?
```{r}
gapminder %>%
group_by(country) %>%
select(-pop, -continent, -year) %>%
arrange (desc(lifeExp, gdpPercap))
```

7. Which combinations of continent (besides Asia) and year have the highest average population across all countries? _N.b. your output should include all results sorted by highest average population_. With what you already know, this one may stump you. See [this Q&A](http://stackoverflow.com/q/27207963/654296) for how to `ungroup` before `arrange`ing. This also [behaves differently in more recent versions of dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/releases/tag/v0.5.0).
```{r}
gapminder %>%
group_by(continent, year) %>%
summarize (pop = mean(pop)) %>%
filter(continent %in% c("Africa", "Americas", "Europe", "Oceania")) %>%
arrange(pop) %>%
ungroup() %>%
arrange(desc(pop))
#The combinations of continent and year that have the highest average population across all countries are: the Americas (1972-2007)
```

8. Which three countries have had the most consistent population estimates (i.e. lowest standard deviation) across the years of available data? 
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country)%>%
  #I am unable to answer this question
```
9. Subset **gm** to only include observations from 1992 and store the results as **gm1992**. What kind of object is this?
```{r}
gm1992 <- gapminder %>%
    filter (year == 1992)
gm1992
#This is a tibble object that sorts all observations based on the year 1992
```
10. Which observations indicate that the population of a country has *decreased* from the previous year **and** the life expectancy has *increased* from the previous year? See [the vignette on window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html).
```{r}
#Use of the lag() function will indicate a decrease in population from the previous year and an increase in life expectancy from the previous year.
```
