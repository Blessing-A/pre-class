## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r }
#Installing Shiny
install.packages("shiny")

```{r }
#Using the example from Walkthrough by Dean Attali to test success of Shiny installation
library(shiny)
runExample("01_hello")
```
```{r }
#Using the basic format for Shiny app to create a shiny app for standard normal distribution
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
div(titlePanel("Simple App for Standard Normal Statistics"), style = "color: green;"),
sidebarLayout(
  sidebarPanel(
    sliderInput("normalInput", "Pick a value", min = 0, max = 100, value = 10)
    ),
  mainPanel(
    plotOutput("simplePlot")
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$simplePlot <- renderPlot({
    x = seq(-5, 5, length = input$normalInput) #provides equally spaced values between -5 and 5 for the length of the sliderInput
    y = 1/sqrt(2*pi)*exp(-x^2/2) #finds the probability density function of each entry of x
    plot(x, y, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "red") #plots y versus x and uses a solid line with line width of 2 and color choice of red for the distribution   
  })
}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
