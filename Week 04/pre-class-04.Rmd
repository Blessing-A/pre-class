## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Question 1:

Using a loop, print the integers from 1 to 50. 
```{r }
integers <- c(1:50) #assigned the integers 1:50 to variable "integer
for(i in 1:length(integers)) { #used i to represent the variables in the length of integers
  print(integers[i]) #printed (integers) as a list
} 
```

### Question 2:

A.  Using a loop, add all the integers between 0 and 1000.
```{r }
all_integers <- c(0:1000) #assigned the name all_integers to numbers from 0 to 1,000
  number <- 0 #assigned the start of number counts to the vector number and stating that number count begins at zero 
for (i in all_integers) { #used the for loop to say that "i" represents every variable in the length of the vector all_integers
  number <- number + i #reassigned the number vector to sum all the values of i starting at zero and add i to the previous number
}
```

B. Now, add all the EVEN integers between 0 and 1000 (hint: use seq())
```{r }
even_integers <- seq(0, 1000, by = 2) #found the number of even integers using the seq() function and increasing the sequence by 2 to get only even numbers
 number <- 0 #assigned the start of number counts to the vector number and stating that number count begins at zero 
for (i in even_integers) { #used the for loop to say that "i" represents every variable in the even_integers vector
  number <- number + i #reassigned the number vector to sum all the even values of i starting at zero and add i to the previous number
}
```
C. Now, repeat A and B WITHOUT using a loop.
```{r }
all_integers <- c(0:1000) #assigned the variable 0 to 1000 to the vector all_integers
sum(all_integers) #used the sum function to find the sum of all the integers between 0 and 1000

even_integers <- seq(0, 1000, by = 2) #found the number of even integers using the seq() function and increasing the sequence by 2 to get only even numbers
sum(even_integers)#used the sum function to find the sum of all the even integers between 0 and 1000
```
### Question 3:

Here is a dataframe of survey data containing 5 questions :

```{r, eval=FALSE}
survey <- data.frame(
                     "participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                     "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                     "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                     "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                     "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                     "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                     )
```
The response to each question should be an integer between 1 and 5. Obviously, we have some bad values in the dataframe. The goal of this problem is to fix them.

A. Using a loop, create a new dataframe called survey.clean where all the invalid values (those that are not integers between 1 and 5) are set to NA.
```{r }
survey.clean <- data.frame ("participant" = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
                            "q1" = c(5, 3, 2, 7, 11, 0),
                            "q2" = c(4, 2, 2, 5, -10, 99),
                            "q3" = c(-4, -3, 4, 2, 9, 10),
                            "q4" = c(-30, 5, 2, 23, 4, 2),
                            "q5" = c(88, 4, -20, 2, 4, 2)
                            ) #assigned data to vector called survey.clean
                   

for (row in 1:length (survey.clean)) { #used the for loop to say that "row" represents every row variable in the survey.clean vector
  for (c in 2:6) { #used the for loop to say that "c" represents every column variable in the survey.clean vector
    if (survey.clean[row,c] > 5 | survey.clean[row,c] < 1) { #used the if statement to select for rows and columns that are between 1 and 5
    survey.clean[row,c] <- NA #assigned NA to rows and columns that had invalid values
    }
  }
}
```
B. Now, again using a loop, add a new column to the dataframe called “invalid.answers” that indicates, for each participant, how many bad answers they gave.
